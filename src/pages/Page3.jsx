          I’m a frontend developer specializing in React, Tailwind CSS, and Three.js, creating responsive, interactive, and visually striking web applications. My focus is on delivering smooth user experiences, clean code, and performance-optimized designs.

          While my current expertise lies in the frontend, I’m consistently expanding my skill set to grow as a full-stack developer. Right now, I’m diving deep into backend development with Flask and SQLAlchemy, learning how to design and integrate efficient server-side systems with my frontend work.

          Every project is a chance to level up my craft — to mix creativity with technical precision — and I’m here to build things that make people stop, click, and smile.</h3>
